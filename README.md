# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor
# Description
We were tasked to strcture the HTML elements in a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. Along with adding accessibility for people with disabilites. Also organize CSS code to be more readable.

In the HTML document I changed all of the DIV elements to specific elements describing their functions. Along with adding comments detailing what was changed. I also added alt attributes do better help disable people understand the images on the page. Lastly I organized the CSS style sheet to allow it to be more readable by condensing a lot of the class elements into each other.
